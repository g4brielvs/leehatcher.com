## Abstract

Research shows the ability to transition from college to a graduate program requires scaffolding and
support from the collegiate curriculum, faculty, and specialized programs. Currently, this transition is not
being supported for BIPOC students in psychology programs based on a lack of the aforementioned. To
better understand what impacts their transition, this proposal aims to investigate the program entitled
“NYU’s Quality Undergraduate Education and Scholarly Training” (QUEST). QUEST is an Applied
Psychology program that aims to mitigate negative transitional factors through mentorship and
engagement in graduate research projects. Phenomenological research will be employed to understand
what its members experienced during the program that impacted their transition from college to
graduate programs. This will be examined through written accounts of its BIPOC members in the form of
journal entries. Their journal entries will be assessed and coded in order to find major themes. An
expected theme includes an increase in the sense of belonging within the realm of graduate studies due
to the program's mentorship and research projects. The implications should guide further research
towards better, more effective graduate readiness programs for BIPOC students.

## Introduction

Within psychology graduate programs, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) students
make up less than 36% of the degree population (Bailey, 2020). This problem is being addressed in very
few ways, and little is known about how the transitional period between college and graduate school
affects BIPOC students. However, it is known that their transition from college to graduate programs is
not currently being supported (Winkle-Wagner & McCoy, 2016). The lack of appropriate curriculum,
diverse faculty, and programs has created barriers keeping students from accessing graduate programs in
psychology (Peteet & Lige, 2016). Because the lack of support is significant for the retention and attrition
rate of students of color in graduate programs (Trent et al., 2021), it is critical to look further into how
graduate programs can provide psychosocial support to their BIPOC students during this transition.

## Literature Review

Disparities in the curricula of psychology programs for BIPOC students establish barriers to
graduate programs (Appleby & Appleby, 2006; Winkle-Wagner & McCoy, 2016). A lack of research
experience is known to be detrimental to students' entry into graduate programs (Linn et al., 2015).
Although some colleges offer students opportunities through research programs, such programs do not
reach most science students, particularly BIPOC students (Arnaud, 2019). Without the proper curriculum
within psychology programs, BIPOC students miss opportunities that would familiarize and help them
transition into graduate school. Specifically, undergraduate research experience for BIPOC students has
shown to cultivate self-efficacy and ambitions, which is crucial for their transition into graduate programs
(Carpi et al. 2016). Yet, they are unable to access these opportunities for several reasons.

One reason is that the lack of faculty diversity within psychology creates a deficit in accessible
curriculum, programs, and mentorship for BIPOC students. It has been shown that faculty of color are likely to facilitate and bring new insights to underrepresented populations (Reskin, 1998). This is crucial
in solving the aforementioned problems toward a successful transition.
Another consequence of the diverse faculty problem is the lack of mentorship that comes with
it. Without representation in faculty, BIPOC students see “the commitment to diversity as superficial”
and less often seek out mentorship from faculty members (Vasquez et al., 2006). Mentorship can be
helpful with the socialization of undergraduate students with graduate programs. Without it, it hinders a
student's ability to traverse the transition from college to graduate programs, as mentors often play an
important role by offering their experience, advice, and wisdom (Rogers & Molina, 2006). A reduced
sense of community comes with this, adding to feelings of isolation that could further prevent students
from successfully transitioning (Rogers & Molina, 2006).

Currently, research has centered on mentorship programs and undergraduate research
experiences as effective ways to mitigate negative effects regarding lack of experience for undergraduate
students wanting to apply to graduate school (Winkle-Wagner & McCoy, 2016, p.181). EMERGE, a
psychology graduate readiness program, for example, “was designed to provide academic readiness,
professional development, and socialization, and admissions preparation all within the context of
cultural considerations” to BIPOC college students (Peteet & Lige, 2016). Their resulting statistics
showed that 54% of those who went on to apply to graduate doctoral programs were all accepted. Yet,
their assessment of their program uses mixed methods that do not address the whole picture. Their
analysis focuses on acceptance into graduate programs as well as overall preparedness but does little to
gain insight into how the transition itself from college to graduate programs felt for the students. This is a common theme for such programs and therefore needs more direct exploration to help delineate how
students feel toward their transition.

One such program in the field of psychology that focuses on BIPOC students’ success in entering
graduate programs is entitled NYU’s Quality Undergraduate Education and Scholarly Training (QUEST).
The QUEST program, very similar to EMERGE, is an opportune program to assess the problem with the
transition to graduate school. Therefore, the proposed research study question aims to answer the
following; what experiences have the QUEST scholars gone through while in the program that impacted
their transition from college to graduate programs? And in what noticeable ways did it impact their
transition?

## Methods

### Study Design

This qualitative research will be rooted in phenomenological studies that aim to examine human
experiences through descriptions supplied by the participants. Phenomenological research helps
develops a more complete, accurate, clear, and articulate description and understanding of a particular
human experience or experiential moment. Participants of the QUEST program are required to journal
their experiences throughout the 8-week program to assess their thoughts and feelings. Specific
questions are not predetermined for this study; as such, all answers will be completely unencumbered
by bias or the feeling of needing to answer in a specific way. By using a phenomenological framework,
the focus will be on examining the essence of an experience from the first-person perspective instead of
just describing a case, like in a case study.

### Procedures

#### The Setting

##### QUEST

QUEST is an 8-week program that prepares undergraduate BIPOC students for graduate
programs; they provide research experiences, networking opportunities, mentorship, and meaningful,
pertinent conversations about social justice, imposter syndrome, and inequities in higher education. The
program is comprised of a QUEST committee that directs the program and its structure, doctoral
students as curriculum coordinators who facilitate the program, and Principal Investigators and Lab
mentors who serve as leaders for research projects.

#### Participants

The participants will all be from the 2018 to 2022 cohorts of QUEST. See Appendix A for the
demographics of members. Demographics are included to demonstrate the program's commitment to
racial diversity and a breakdown of participants' backgrounds. Participants will remain anonymous unless
otherwise noted to ensure the confidentiality of participants.

#### Data Collection

For data analysis, an interpretive phenomenological analysis will be used to analyze journal
entries from QUEST members. Several analysts will code Journals entries in extensive detail, with the
focus shifting back and forth between the key points made by participants and researchers'
interpretations of those key points made. Analysis should aim to make sense of participants’ perceptions
of their experiences, and researchers will generate codes from the data. Researchers will annotate the text closely for insights relating to the participants’ experiences and perspectives. Emerging codes will be
cataloged, and researchers will look for patterns/themes within the codes. Final themes will be
summarized and put into a table with salient quotes from participants that best represent the theme.

## Findings

The findings of phenomenology are usually listed as “major themes,” which would emerge
throughout the coding process. Expected major themes that may emerge throughout the research study
include increasing their sense of belonging within the realm of graduate studies through their
mentorship and engagement with graduate research projects, a decrease in feelings of imposter
syndrome, and improving their confidence in research skills.

## Discussion

Results from the research are expected to reveal that the QUEST program is able to help BIPOC
students transition from college to graduate school through appropriate curriculum and mentorship. It is
expected they do so by mitigating feelings of anxiety and imposter syndrome and building a support
system that addresses systemic and institutional problems that affect them. Findings should guide
subsequent research to investigate similar questions to assess the applicability of such programs as
QUEST on a larger scale. Implications from this study should help inform other programs about
important factors BIPOC students encounter that make a smooth transition from college to graduate
school. Programs should use this information to help instill confidence in BIPOC students when applying
to graduate programs and to create more awareness of the problem. Further, by reforming the transition
process, graduate programs should become more accessible to BIPOC students over time, enabling new
generations to diversify their fields.
