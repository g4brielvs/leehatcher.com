Augusten Burroughs, aged 27, is a caucasian male whose first and only language is
English. His current occupation is as a creative freelancer in the advertising business. He lives in
an apartment in an affluent part of Manhattan, New York. Mr. Burrough’s presenting problem, as
stated by coworkers, has been that ``[There are] many instances where [his] drinking has had an
effect on [his] performance- I myself have smelled alcohol on [him] numerous times''
(Burroughs, 2003, p.20). His boss and coworkers set up an intervention to send Augusten to
rehab to hopefully help with his drinking problem while allowing him to retain his position at his
current job. When first presented with this, Mr. Burrough’s believed he could attend and then
continue with his previous ways. However, when committed to the Proud Institute, an LGBTQ+
friendly rehab center, he realizes that it is a serious effort to help him get sober (Burroughs,
2003).
Mr. Burroughs principal presenting problem is his alcoholism however, he also struggles
with a nicotine addiction as well as other substance abuse after he is released from rehab. As
stated by the client, he began drinking around the age of 13 and began smoking before then
(Burroughs, 2003). His substance abuse of crack cocaine, cocaine, and other miscellaneous drugs
was only on occasion -roughly once every few months- until his release from the Proud Institute.
Around 10 months after his release and nearly two months after his first relapse with alcohol, Mr.
Burroughs began abusing crack cocaine on a more frequent basis; one such time led him to
realize, “This is it. I am rock-bottom, on the subway. I have to stop. I cannot end up like that”
(Burroughs, 2003, p.279). However, even with his preoccupation and reflection with his use of
crack cocaine and alcohol, he continues to use both substances.

Until the intervention with his boss and coworkers, Mr. Burroughs was naive to his
alcohol addiction. When presented, he successfully completed 90 days at the rehabilitation
facility called the Proud Institute where he was taught coping skills and completed a twelve-step
program. After his release, he attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings once a day and as
needed, went to group therapy once a week, and had a one on one therapy session once weekly.
This treatment helped with Mr. Burroughs success in sobriety, although he stopped going to
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings a few months after he left rehab, believing it was not helpful
for him. Before rehab, his alcohol addiction was considered severe, meeting the DSM 5 criteria
of having six or more symptoms. He also met this criterion during his relapse period of ten
months.

Mr. Burroughs’ relapse happened roughly ten months after his attendance at the Proud
Institute. As described, it was due to a very emotional death of a close friend that was the reason
for his relapse (Burroughs, 2003). His drinking became even more severe during this time period
as well as his use of cocaine and crack cocaine. However, currently, Mr. Burroughs is in recovery
and attending AA meetings regularly with a friend who is also a recovering alcoholic. His
current severity is considered mild.
Mr. Burroughs has a long history with alcohol. He reports that his father was a heavy
drinker who was sometimes physically abusive with himself and his mother (Burroughs, 2002).
His father was a college professor who had a turbulent relationship with his wife due to his
drinking and the stress that accompanied his job. Mr. Burroughs’ mother has a history of
prescription substance abuse, particularly valium and Xanax (Burroughs, 2002). She struggled
with her own undiagnosed mental illness when Mr. Burroughs was a teenager which led her to
have him adopted by her therapist (Robison, 2011). The living situation was extremely unhealthy, and Ms. Burroughs was to be considered a neglectful parent as she was frequently
absent in Mr. Burroughs's life. She would leave for weeks, up to months at a time with no
contact, leaving him in the care of her psychiatrist/therapist’s care where he often did not have
access to adequate food, water, shelter, or clothing. This greatly affected his physical and mental
health both then and now.

Additionally, during this time when Ms. Burroughs was absent, Mr. Burroughs began to
be sexually abused by a close family friend who was referred to as his uncle. This man was 30
years old while Mr. Burroughs was 13; their sexual relationship lasted six to eight months before
his abuser completely left his life. While being sexually abused, Mr. Burroughs was often
exposed to mental and emotional abuse, as their ‘relationship’ was manipulative, contingent on
his abuser’s happiness. The mental and emotional abuse was also perpetuated by Mr. Burroughs'
now guardian, Ms. Burroughs' psychiatrist. He often would make inappropriate, sexual
comments and had a room he coined the “mastrubitorium” that was supposed to promote open
masturbation within the home (Burroughs, 2002). This was detrimental to Mr. Burroughs mental
health and he would often act out. Because of this, Mr. Burroughs did not attend school past the
third grade; his new guardian believed in free-range learning where everything was picked up
from a child’s interaction with the world around it and not in a traditional classroom setting
(Burroughs, 2002). It also helped to perpetuate the abuse as it could not be reported, nor would
Mr. Burroughs know any better. Despite his poor education and upbringing, Mr. Burroughs had
several opportunities later in life to improve it. He moved to Boston, having saved money from
being a Ground Round waiter where he then attended a trade school titled Control Data Institute
(Burroughs, 2016). He completed his degree but decided to go into advertising instead.

Ms. Burroughs’ mental health was the main factor that led her to give up her son. She
was seeing this psychiatrist that she wholeheartedly trusted; his intentions were not so innocent.
Her mental health often kept her away from her son; she was hospitalized several times, ranging
from a few days to more than a month in time (Robison, 2011). She suffered from depression
with psychotic episodes (Robison, 2011). At present, there are no underlying symptoms that
would show Mr. Burroughs suffers from the same conditions as his mother but he has a
tumultuous relationship with his mental health which he covers up through his alcohol and drug
use.

Due to Mr. Burroughs lack of conventional education, he struggled with getting a job
during his teenage years. He performed odd jobs throughout his life but caught a break with an
advertising agent who brought him onto his team; thus he now works as a freelance writer
(Burroughs, 2011). However, he has been somewhat steadily employed since the age of 18 and
now continues to work with the same advertising agency that intervened to help him enter rehab.
Having this employment allows him to provide him with all of his basic needs such as food,
water, shelter, and clothing. He is mostly upper-middle-class at this time, making enough money
to comfortably support himself and buy wanted, frivolous items. His class status enables him to
support his eccentric drinking habits Mr. Burroughs does not subscribe to any religious
affiliations at this time.

The social support that he has is somewhat extensive; he had a lot of help while in rehab
from professionals and therapists who specialize in substance abuse. He particularly was fond of
Rae, a one-on-one therapist as well as David who led group counseling sessions. After his
program, he was supported further through new group therapy, as well as one on one therapy
with his new counselor named Wendy. He also had alcoholics anonymous members he could reach out to for help if needed but these people he did not have any close connection to.
Furthermore, during a period of six months, a close friend of his who was also a recovering
alcoholic as well as a crack addict lived with and endorsed him. This friend often helped put
perspective on Mr. Burroughs' situation. Despite this, Mr. Burroughs obtained an unhealthy
relationship with a recovering crack cocaine addict he met in his group therapy after a few weeks
of attending. This relationship lasted roughly six months and eventually led Mr. Burroughs to try
crack cocaine with this partner. Soon after, his partner went back to living with an ex-boyfriend
who was also a crack addict and was physically and emotionally abusive and manipulative. This
led to a turbulent relationship in Mr. Burroughs' life as he no longer had someone who would
support his alcoholic problems and he wanted to smoke more, yet did not have the means to do
so. At this time, his situation spiraled out of control and he cut a large portion of his support
system out of his life.

Following the departure of his partner, Mr. Burroughs sought out alcohol and crack
cocaine. While doing so, he was still able to meet his basic necessities yet his quality of living
deteriorated; his condition worsened and became the most severe yet. For a while, all he did was
eat and get drunk. This went on for months until he became poisoned by the alcohol. He began to
hallucinate and then got a high-grade fever followed by flu-like symptoms. These worsened
quickly and he then developed hives all over his legs which fused together and began to bleed.
He also describes visual hallucinations of many spiders being around or on him; “Tonight there
are many spiders. The ceiling is filled with them. I turn on the light and there are none. I
understand now that I am hallucinating” (Burroughs, 2003, p. 286). This is congruent with
chronic, late-stage alcoholism. However, despite knowing this, he sought no immediate medical
treatment for this, instead deciding to taper his alcohol consumption down over the next 72 hours. After an unknown period of time, Mr. Burroughs again was in remission and subsequently
had been going back to AA; his condition would be considered mild at present, as he has had no
alcohol nor has he had a relapse known to date since his remission. His strengths include a
focused mindset which has previously served him well while in rehab, at work, and most likely
will serve him well during this time period. Mr. Burroughs additionally has expanded his support
system to include a very close friend as well as a close coworker.

Based on the existing information, Mr. Burroughs would meet the criteria for Alcohol
Use Disorder, Alcohol intoxication, and Alcohol withdrawal at differing points thus far.
Prevailing, his symptoms are as follows:

1. Persistent desire to cut down or control alcohol use
2. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol

Because only two DSM-5 criteria are met, his Alcohol use disorder would be considered
a mild case. However, for clarity and perspective, it is best to focus on Mr. Burrough at the
height of his addiction. At that time, he met the following criteria:

1. Alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a long period of time than was
intended
2. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use
3. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain alcohol, use alcohol, or
recover from its effects
4. Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol
5. Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations at work,
school, or home
6. Continued alcohol use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal
problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol
7. Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced
because of alcohol use
8. Alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent
physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated
by alcohol
9. Tolerance as defined by the following:
a. A need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol
b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of
alcohol
10. Withdrawal as manifested by the following:

    a. Alcohol is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms

    b. The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol

He would also meet the criteria for Alcohol intoxication as seen by his recent ingestion of
alcohol that has caused such symptoms as impairments in attention or memory, stupor, and
incoordination. While all of these symptoms point to his intoxication by alcohol, it must be noted
that because Mr. Burroughs has a history of other substance abuse; it is possible that some of the
symptoms may be caused or comorbid with his current state.
Further, during the time right after his alcohol poisoning, he met the criteria for alcohol
withdrawal as denoted by a reduction in alcohol use that was previously heavy and prolonged,
followed by nausea and vomiting, transient visual hallucinations, and psychomotor agitation. As
recorded previously, Mr. Burroughs had visual hallucinations and therefore his withdrawal
should be specified that it is with perceptual disturbances.
Looking at Mr. Burroughs' entire history, a differential diagnosis might come in the form
of conduct disorder in childhood or adult antisocial personality disorder. As previously
mentioned, Mr. Burroughs acted out quite a bit as a child. Based upon the self description it is
unknown whether he would meet the criteria for this disorder but may very well so. Further
history would need to be gathered from outside sources for a proper determination.
As stated by the client, he feels the need to drink heavily to be able to socialize with
others comfortably. Even when he is drunk, he spends most of his time alone, never allowing
anyone in his apartment (Burroughs, 2003). He actively avoids people at his work due to him not
being drunk enough to interact comfortably and often lies about his sobriety. Furthermore, his
deceitfulness bleeds into his everyday life; he lies about his tardiness, he lies to friends about
what he is doing or where he is, and he chronically lies to his coworker and boss about his work.

Mr. Burroughs also struggles with impulsivity, often doing as he pleases despite the
consequences. An extreme example of this would be when he bought crack cocaine from a
stranger while walking down the street, having had no previous intention to buy any type of drug
beforehand. His impetuous behavior led him to asking a prostitute and her pimp to teach him
how to smoke the crack. All of which would guide toward a possible diagnosis of antisocial
personality disorder. It should be taken into consideration however, that these findings are taken
when Mr. Burroughs was not completely sober and therefore cannot be ruled out as behavior due
to intoxication; same goes for his drug use.
Further, while Mr. Burroughs does not meet criteria for an anxiety disorder, anxiety could
be a contributing factor that affects his mood or reactions in certain situations. Therefore, this
should be further explored in treatment to assess its role within his life, if at all, and then discuss
ways in which it can be mitigated.
There is a wide range of treatment options available for Mr. Burroughs. Given his current
sobriety, detox and withdrawal is not needed at this time. However, first and foremost, Mr.
Burroughs needs to seek psychological counseling from a professional therapist who is skilled in
working with patients who have a relationship with addiction. In particular, Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy (CBT) could be especially successful for Mr.Burroughs as it focuses on redirecting his
way of thinking. It will help combine the coping skills that he learned in rehab and previous
forms of therapy to reasonably fit into his life. This will help keep him on track for being sober,
as well as address some other problems he may be facing in his life.
If CBT treatment goes well and Mr. Burroughs prospers from it, Trauma Focused
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy should then be considered. Given his tumultuous past and the
many traumatizing events he has experienced throughout his life, included but not limited to the sexual abuse, alcohol and drug abuse, neglect and abandonment as well as other unknown
traumas that may surface, it would greatly benefit seeking this route. It may get to some root
causes of Mr. Burroughs drinking; upsetting or distorted beliefs surrounding his trauma may be a
cause that could be addressed through this. Additionally, it would help him learn skills to cope
with ordinary life stressors that would normally cause him to drink or use substances.
If however, Mr. Burroughs does not respond well to CBT, it is suggested that he try
Dialectic Behavioral Therapy (DBT). This type of therapy has been used to help those who
struggle with substance abuse disorders, such as the one Mr. Burroughs lives with. In particular,
this approach would focus more on mindfulness skills to help him slow down and focus on using
positive coping mechanisms. It can also be used for calmness which may help in avoiding
impulsive behaviors that could lead to substance use. Another element that he would highly
benefit off of from this therapy is learning distress tolerance skills. This teaches skills to help
handle a crisis he may encounter. Techniques include: distraction, improving the moment,
self-soothing, and thinking of the pros and cons of distress.
He should also be referred to a psychiatrist to confirm or deny a differential diagnosis of
antisocial personality disorder or any other mental illness that may be affecting Mr.Burroughs.
This would also be an opportune time to disseminate potential pharmacological treatments that
may benefit Mr. Burroughs, if any at all.
Mr. Burroughs should continue his regular Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in addition
with his suggested treatment plan. In the case of another relapse, Mr. Burroughs should be
admitted to a residential treatment facility to help with the process of detoxing.
