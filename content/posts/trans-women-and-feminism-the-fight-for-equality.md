In 2016, Ricky Gervais, actor, and comedian made a joke about Caitlyn Jenner while
hosting the Golden Globes. She had recently gotten into trouble for having caused a fatal car
crash, which was cause for Gervais’s joke claiming that she may have become a role model but
“didn’t do alot for women drivers.&quot; His entire monologue is tinged with sexist comments against
the female audience, saying things such as “female [film] remakes are the big thing- and this is
brilliant for the studios because they get guaranteed box office results and they don’t have to
spend too much money on the cast!” The camera panned at this time to show the mixed reaction
from the audience. He takes 15 minutes to propagate male white dominance over women,
especially financially. And at the time, it was obvious that the audience found humor in the
Jenner joke, laughing along and smiling but they increasingly became less responsive and
agitated by the sexist comments that followed.

Flash forward to December 2019, mere weeks before he was scheduled to host the 2020
golden globes, he tweeted this: “Those awful biological women can never understand what it
must be like for you becoming a lovely lady so late in life. They take their girly privileges for
granted. Winning at female sports and having their own toilets. Well, enough is enough.” His
comment was in response to Jarvis Dupont, an internet troll who often poses as a trans woman to
further make the minority look less than reasonable and unintellectual. Jarvis, who was
commenting on a string of transphobic tweets J.K Rowling had put out, had been sardonically
making fun of trans women once again by pretending to be one. Gervias never outright
comments about Rowling, but dances around many of the ‘funny’ ideas that come with her
tweets. Because of the atmosphere, he built by doing so, it is easy to connect that Gervais was emulating Dupont, even if he tried to play it off as a mere joke. “As his followers responded,
Gervais dug deeper, accusing ‘men’ of eroding ‘the rights of women’ through a ‘new cunning
way to dominate and demonize an entire sex’” writes Dawn Ennis of Forbes magazine. Whether
this was another ‘joke’ or a way of trying to further mock the women who were responding, it is
difficult to say for sure. But it is clear that just as he had been so crude at the previous Golden
Globes, he had created a sarcastic tweet storm that ultimately demeaned all women. Gervais had
so little tact with the tweets, not just because of the untimeliness of the distastefulness, but
because he was clearly distinguishing ‘real’ women from trans women.

This distinction between “biological” and trans women creates a divide in the feminist
community something that Gervais was keen to comment on. One British journalist, Janice
Turner, who was also responding to Rowling’s tweets, said, “The sheer viciousness of attacks on
[@jk_rowling](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling) for affirming that ‘sex is real’ reminds me how Galileo was sent to the Inquisition
for saying the Earth moves around the Sun. Doctors &amp; scientists are denying science for fear of
the mob” to which Gervais was in agreement, even if he tried to make it seem sarcastic. Turner’s
comment was furthering a notion made by Rowling that the inclusion of trans women in law
goes against why they were put in place: to distinguish and protect the rights of biological
women. Tension has always been apparent regarding the inclusion of trans women, yet because
of comments like Gervais&#39;s and Turner&#39;s, it underlines the arrogance of deep unawareness and
ignorance, which is why the backlash was so major. Whether it was his intention or not, the
tweet highlights a greater problem being discussed; should trans women be included in the
feminst community?

To begin with, it is highly important to point out the discrepancy of Gervais’s argument
and to define some key terms that will play a large role in this essay. Sex as defined by the
Merriam-Webster dictionary is considered “either of the two major forms of individuals that
occur in many species and that are distinguished respectively as female or male especially on the
basis of their reproductive organs and structures”. One thing that should also be noted are the
abnormalities that a do not fall under this definition of sex. For example, a portion of people are
born intersex, meaning that they do not fit into either category denoted in Merriam-Webster’s
definition of sex. Instead, they create their own category based upon what reproductive organs,
or lack thereof, they have. This definition of sex indicates the biological differences between
males and females to classify them into two groups, however gender is far more encompassing.
Gender, as defined by the same dictionary, is described as “the behavioral, cultural, or
psychological traits typically associated with one sex.” The subtle differences that are needed
here, are the bases that define them. Sex relies on biology and reproductive organs while gender
includes aspects of sex not mentioned before. It can be thought of stereotypes associated with
either sex or even secondary sex characteristics that others use to percieve the gender of
someone. It is used to generalize how others percieve another person in relation to the expression
of one sex or the other. This is something Gervais seemingly ignored by distinctly pursuing
‘humor’ at the expense of those expressing their gender: trans women. His ignorance is what
created a more sarcastic, undermining tone that clearly overlooked an entire community’s basis
and unwittingly talked down to them. While some may have found it light hearted and funny, it
is a serious issue that needs to be addressed further, starting with a better basic understanding of
gender identity.

Under gender falls gender identity which will be my main focus. This can also be
thought of as self expression of either, both, or neither sex and often allows for the exploration
between the aformentioned sexes. Then there is the category transgender, which is, “of, relating
to, or being a person whose gender identity differs from the sex the person had or was identified
as having at birth.” It is used as an umbrella term, normally to describe people who identify
within the binary who don&#39;t identify with the sex they were born with. While many can agree on
the description, the argument lies on the borders of sex and gender which is where our final key
term comes in: TERF. TERF stands for Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist (or Female) and
has been used previously in a deragitory way, meant to denote negative attributes and values
associated with being a certaint type of radical feminist. While many who are subjected to the
word feel it is a way of silencing, or being sexist towards those who speak out against trans
women, I am only using it as a descriptor of whom I will be discussing. It is not a word I use
with any negative connotations attached to it.

One of the most intriguing parts about the discussion is the foundation of TERF feminism
in respect to the ‘patriarchy’. It still is a relatively new ideology, gaining its traction in the
seventies from feminists who wanted equality. In Andrea Long Chu’s essay “The Impossibility
of Feminism”, the idea of the patriarchy was established by key feminists in the seventies, using
it as an answer to oppression and as Chu sites it, ‘bad sex’. Her essay details the underlying idea
that the patriarchy was created and then described to be “a non materialist, or if you like,
culturalist claim: the ‘essence’ of patriarchy—its soul, its principle, its Idea, even—is not
economic, but ‘psychological.’” This meant that it was based upon physical characteristics and
differences between men and women, often addressing the ‘power behind a penis’ or marked by
the overpowerment of a man in many aspects without respect to the economy; they are
physiologically superior (Chu 70). It is “ in relations of intimacy, affect, and desire” that the
patriarchy resides, however; men are the dominate sex inside the bedroom and in order to to be a
radical feminist, one must prove restraint or disregard to that power (Chu 70).

The creation of the patriarchy was in response to an outcry for visibility on sexual
assault, and the power and control men held over women. Or as Chu puts it, “[The] patriarchy
existed, quite simply, because women could feel it.” The overbearing, overwhelming sense that
men had something inherently puissant, whether it be their masculinity associated with having a
penis or the perceived aggressive sexual nature, implied there was an imbalance between the two
sexes. This tension was what led to the creation of women-only spaces: places that served the
purpose of fulfilling the need for these radical feminists to be distanced from the patriarchy. It
allowed for open discussion and operated as a safe place for biological women. It was especially
popularized among the lesbian community, backed feverently by them due to, should I even say,
fairly obvious reasons. Homosexuality and the patriarchy was rooted in disagreement over the
prowess of a man’s role in regards to women. So as seen from the patriarchy, men who love men
were wrong for not asserting themselves with women, and women who love women were seen as
dispicable for denying their classist role as a reproductive apparatus, or at least that was the
patriarchal perspective from the feminist thought on it. As Chu put it, “ feminist theory has
always been about who’s fucking whom”(Chu 72). Coming back to today’s TERF views on
feminism, we notice not a lot has changed. Yet, an entire world around them has and is
continuing to do so.

While things like terminology might not be the same, a lot of the values that existed in
the seventies still hold true today for TERFs, even when ideals such as gender identity are
evolving. For example, the previously mentioned women only, especially lesbian only, spaces
have been in consistent decline. The TERF ideology places the blame upon trans women; they
represent a form of the patriarchal culturist claim because by inherently having a penis or having
had one, it threatens the sanctity and pureness of their philosophy.

 As Ros Kaveney put it in the
article “Woman Enough”, TERFs think that “trans women exist in order to give the idea of
gender plausibility, and to divide women’s community by entering it, something TERF theorist
Janice Raymond compared to rape in her 1979 book The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the
She-Male.” If anyone wants more information from one TERF perspective, The Transexual
Empire details just where the beliefs of Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists stand;
unsurprisingly, the book focuses heavily on trans women, honing in on why the world should not
just reject them, but completely tear them down (Kaveney 1). It is blatantly transphobic,
asserting itself as a worldly outlook that should be universally adopted. Raymond’s book and life
work has been to oppress, silence, and degrade trans women; she finds ways to disrupt their
everyday lives while simultaneously working to have all of their legal rights taken away from
them (Kaveney 1). In one case, she &quot;called for a boycott of lesbian feminist record company
Olivia for using trans woman Sandy Stone as a sound engineer,&quot; purely because Raymond
believes any feminist ideology that accepts trans women goes against the cause feminism was
founded on; it is not enough to disregard, TERFs must work to push them out, not just from their
spaces but to ostracize and isolate them from the world (Kaveney 1). I digress from it however,
in fear of shining too much unnecessary light on Raymond’s despicable life works and literature
that aims to propagate discrimination. However, from Raymond and other TERFs perspectives,
trans women have pushed women out from their own safe spaces, causing a disruption to the
ecosystem that is meant to promote women in the world.

Yet, as Tracy Blaim contends in her article, “The Battle Within: Cis and Trans Women,
Can We Get Along?” we must question the factual basis of this argument in addition to the
biases that perpetuate this thought. Blaim is a biological woman who identifies as lesbian, one
who has lived long enough to see the evolution of trans women in the feminist society. She
focuses on the battles fought between trans women, cisgender lesbians and biological women,
both today and in ‘ancient’ times, reffering as far back as the ninteen seventies. Her article
juggles the changing of “ the orthodoxy- especially over generations,” and hones in on why it is
that lesbian only spaces are in decline (Blaim 1). Her term orthodoxy is used to describe how
large groups of people see transgender people. For the seventies patriarchal ideology, the
orthodoxy was more conservative, maintaining the exclusion of the minority of &#39;out&#39; trans people
from any prospect of their idealic, radical form of feminism. In today’s case, the orthodoxy has
changed to reflect left leaning views of acceptance and better understanding for the equal right of
trans people. She claims the decline in women only and lesbian only spaces is not because of
trans women at all but that the orthodoxy has been pentetrated by TERF ideology as it once had.
Blaim goes on to write that the real blame is to be placed on “generational change” because
“people change” and with this change comes new ways of living (Blaim 1). It happens to
everything and everyone in the world; change is an inevitable thing.

Ellena Rosenthal of Willamete Weekly agrees with Blaim, saying that there is less and
less need for these labels and spaces for people to connect. For her, the transformation of
termonolgy eveovled to be inclusive of queer folk and the transgender community, therefore the
cause for exclusivity to promote bonds amongst the LGBT+ community is needed less than
before. She cites Sally McWilliams, a professor of women and gender studies at PSU, who
discusses this change in pace amongst her students. Rosenthal comments on McWilliams work
as a professor, saying that “more of her female students call themselves queer than lesbian,
telling her the term lesbian feels too limiting. It got to the point that she questioned whether she
should continue to offer her course in lesbian literature, believing it may no longer be relevant.”
So the reasoning for the subsequent decrease is a lot more simple; even though the number of
&#39;out&#39; lesbians is increasingly growing, the need for spaces to congregate segregated from others is
decreasing. For Blaim and Rosenthal, this looks like a better world outlook because the lesbian
community has found ways to connect with each other without the need for exclusivity. They
have integrated into society with less resistance than before and are able to be more open with
others outside of closed doors or private areas. That, and she feels as though if there were a need
or if lesbians wanted them, they could create these spaces once again (Blaim 2).

Backlash to the arguments that Blaim and Rosenthal present comes from people all over the
globe. An organization called The Women’s Human Rights Campaign released a declaration in
March of 2019, supported by a myriad of women’s organizations from all across the world, that
aims at excluding and denouncing trans women from legal rights. It was written by various
women, some who wished to stay anonymous, and has gained seemingly a lot of traction within
the TERF community. In their declaration entitled the “Declaration on Women’s Sex-Based
Rights: Full Text” they state that “the concept of ‘gender identity’ is used to justify the intrusion
of men and boys into single-sex spaces” (O&#39;Hara, Maureen, et al. 3). Unlike Blaim or Rosenthal,
these authors and supporters believe there is an ever increasing need for the women only spaces,
with clarification of who is considered a woman. And while women may benefit from seperate
spaces as they did before, it is clear here that just as Gervais had in his tweets, they have created
a clear contrast grounded between sex and gender, but additionally on the instrinsic idea of the
patriarchy to demean transgender women.

It is important to dig deeper into these ideas but first, I would like to further discuss more
about how the role of gender identity has changed what being a woman means to some feminists.
Gender identity is an all encompassing term used to include all forms and types of gender
expression, including the transgender identity. It is a self reported identification that permits for
exploration and self expression not just as the opposite sex, but outside the binary spectrum
based upon sex as well. This means that a person could identify under not only as the previously
mentioned transgender identity, but as nonbinary as well; this would mean that a person feels no
strong pull toward the stereotypes of either sex and instead exists somewhere in the middle or off
of the spectrum of gender. Gender identity is very meaningful in a harmful way to TERFs
because the ideology of it threatens what they have based their feminism on. To accept the idea
of gender identity blurs the lines between sexes, and what they believe to be the empirical
differences between men and women. By doing so, it is thought that the “protection of such
‘identities’, [is] ultimately leading to the erosion of the gains made by women over decades,”
(O&#39;Hara, Maureen, et al. 3). The idea ferments in the stereotypes of sexes and much of the ideals
of the patriarchy. In a sense, trans women are undermining the progress of biological, or also
reffered to as cisgender, women because of the confusion they create regarding the foundation of
their ideology.

I must say that there does need to be a distinction between sex and gender, if only to
further break down stereotypes. However, if trans women are contended from both sides to be
men because of their biology, then neither side ‘wins’. In the case of the feminists, excluding
trans women on the bases that they do not have the correct reproductive sex organs, irrespective
of actions taken to transition, then they allow the patrairchy to further oppress a group of women.
For the patriarchy, a man disowning his masculinity or even worse, his own penis, is a direct act
of feminism according to the ideals set forth. As aforementioned, in order to fit the criteria of the
radical feminism aforposed, they must show restraint or disregard to the power a man yields,
which is majorly linked with his penis. When a TERF does not recognize this patriarchal
perspective they have set forth, he or she remains ignorant to their own hypocrisy. Because of
this first and foremost fault, they are further unable to see how detrimental their ideas and
practices are in society.

I must point out how their neglect of foresight for their own patriarchal claim is a
hindrance to their cause. On the basis of stereotypes based upon sex, the TERF community relies
heavily on not just biology but the associations made based on it. This would include things such
as secondary sex characteristics (ie facial hair or deepening of voice for men and breasts or wider
hips for women). To help justify the cause for using sex as the predominant factor of feminsim,
they acknowledge and rely on these traits to further determine wether a person fits the standard
categorizations set forth for a man or woman. Inherently, these traits follow the guidelines
attributed to each sex but are only an addition in identifying the differences between either sex.
So, for a feminist to ascertain that a man is a man without seeing his genitals, it is the axiom that
he will almost certainly show other signs such as facial hair or an abundance of body hair, a
deeper voice, or even muscle mass and particular bone structure.

However, in the decleration they state that, “the concept of ‘gender identity’ makes
socially constructed stereotypes, which organize and maintain women’s inequality, into essential
and innate conditions, thereby undermining women’s sex-based rights,” (O&#39;Hara, Maureen, et al.
4). Two of the things stated in this must be addressed in order to reveal an innate truth. The first
is that they state that it is these stereotypes established by gender identity that “maintain
women’s inequality”. I had neglected to be forthcoming before hand with one of their later
claims: “It has long been understood in the area of human rights that the stereotyped sex roles of
men and women are a fundamental aspect of women’s inequality and must be eliminated,”
(O&#39;Hara, Maureen, et al. 6). For me to establish that their claim was based on falsities, I had to
show the hypocrisy that they stand by. It is fundamental to the feminist assertion that they must
break down stereotypes to insight equality. Yet, here, they simultaneously are wanting the
disestablishment of stereotypes while also trying to maintain those standards to degrade trans
women and keep them out of the feminist community. This includes not only promoting the use
of secondary sex characterists but the very gender roles they impose, such as men having
inherent dominance. From the perspective of a TERF, trans women are men and therefore still
possess some type of superiority over them. TERF women project these stereotypes onto trans
women only to further their argument and encourage transphobia; gender identity would not
exist if it were not trying to go against the rigid categories set for a man or woman. Therefore,
the TERF perspective should theoretically be accepting of trans women, yet they move beyond
this to try and make their point.

The second part to be addressed then, is how their ideology then carries into other
worldly aspects and stereotypes such as getting certain jobs because their biology causes them to
be more assertive or domineering; this is how we know they are a man. Chu represents this when
describing, “the political, like the sexual, is fundamentally predicated on a relationship of super-
and subordination” even going as far as to say that the dominace in sex is synomus with that of
the political world (Chu 71). Now, while this is something I agree that should be disestablished, I
want to create a strong line where the argument is. TERFs maintain there must be distinct
differences between men and women for feminism to be grounded. So, because there must be
these biological differences in order for TERF existence, all the while these same differences
create a societal problem, it creates a rift in their argument. I believe that there must be action
taken against the dominance of man in the work or political space, yet this argument is about
deception. As Blaim puts it, “this would be like people who said to us growing up that we should
be straight, that it&#39;s our duty to serve men, to have babies in a heterosexual context” (Blaim 1).

By forcing trans women to live by their terminology, TERFs are enacting and calling upon others
to commit the same transgressions they previously fought against themselves.
Another way that TERFs try to exclude trans women is by asserting that the role of
bearing children rests solely at the hands of biological women which additionally disbands the
idea that stereotypes need to be eliminated. The sexual reproductive organs first and foremost
determine whether someone is or is not female. It should be noted that the possibility to
reproduce is sheltered by the idea, meaning that young girls are protected by it because they have
the potential to have a period and make children. This is a distinct biological counterpoint to the
male penis and the vagina, conversely, is their power against it. In this instance for the promotion
of biological females, TERFs say that, “Maternal rights and services are based on women’s
unique capacity to gestate and give birth to children. The inclusion of men who claim a female
‘gender identity’ within the legal category of mother erodes the social significance of maternity,
and undermines the maternal rights for which the CEDAW provides,” (O&#39;Hara, Maureen, et al.
5). As they cite, the CEDAW stands for ‘Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of
Discrimination against Women’ and was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 18
December 1979. It protects women’s right through the United Nations based on sex. While at the
time the CEDAW may have helped and been progressive, it is outdated evidence that
corresponds with the same time period of the establishment of their ideology. This shows part of
their bias in the declaration and I must combat the CEDAW legislation and TERF ideals by
citing that they exclude a large population of women, not just the intended trans women.
This proposed idea that only women who can carry children to term are deemed women
is completely absurd. For their proposition to be true, this means that any woman unable to prove
the ability to have a child, is essentially not a woman. This goes without mentioning those who
choose not to have children. However, young girls are protected by this idea despite their very
stable view on maternity, for which I will not bring up to object because the logic of this is
dependent on the TERF definition at the time. However, by proposing that only women able to
carry a child to term are considered for this feminist ideal of woman, then they are completely
ignoring a minority supposedly within their group. By adding this complication, TERFs exclude
women who miscarry, women who choose to have abortions, or women simply unable to have a
period, get pregnant, or stay pregnant.

According to the CDC and HHS, “about ten in 100 (6.1
million) women in the United States ages 15–44 have difficulty becoming pregnant or staying
pregnant.” This includes about one third of women who experience infertility due their own
reproductive problems that include a myriad of medical conditions. By ignoring these conditions,
TERF culture quintessentially overlooks, or perhaps decides to disregard, an entire subgroup
based upon the need to be transphobic towards trans women. But wait, there’s more.
In anticipation of this argument, the declaration brings up surrogacy which is used in
some cases when a woman is unable to get pregnant on her own. While they do not say anything
against it, their judgement of trans women using it as a way to become a mother comes off
sharply. When discussing the problem of motherhood, “the use of ‘surrogate’ motherhood, which
exploits and commodifies women’s reproductive capacity,” should be reserved fully to only
biological women (O&#39;Hara, Maureen, et al. 5). But, if it is used to ‘exploit’ and ‘commodify’
women’s reproductive capacity, something that is innately meant to represent womanhood, then
is it not also a way of discrediting anyone who chooses to use it? And is it not true that, on the
basis of breaking down stereotypes, that depending on a sexist classification of motherhood
(saying it is the sole role for a woman to act as a mother) is meant only to further promote those
gender roles in society? It goes right back to the duplicity that comes with trying to found
feminism on sex. It innately causes a disruption between the oppression and those who are being
oppressed.

Lastly on the topic, they describe the impact surrogacy for trans women has as it,
“underpins medical research which is aimed at enabling men to gestate and give birth to
children,” (O&#39;Hara, Maureen, et al. 5.). In other words, they say that because trans women use
surrogacy, they [men] are undermining the medical research that has been done to try to allow
men to have children ‘naturally’. I only mention it to somewhat debase and point out bias in
their work. In my own research for this essay, I was unable to find any scholarly or scientific
research done on humans in this field. Since they do not cite where this idea and research has
come from, I can only conclude that they are less formally discussing ideas about male
pregnancy in other species in relation to human biology. This would include relating symptoms
of pregnancy in a man to other species such as seahorses or pipefish and often includes signs of
pregnancy while around a woman who is pregnant, or a ‘sympathy pregnancy’. It was an idea
coined in the seventies that does not have any factual basis about a man being able to get,
maintain, and birth a child however. It is evident what little factual evidence they supply as to
why the right of motherhood should only be afforded to biological women. In a way, by using
this alongside their surrogacy argument, it could actually help promote men using surrogacy
because it is one of the few valid options of having a child without necessarily having a woman
partner in the picture.

One of the larger debates that extends past just TERF ideology and stakes claim in
policy, are the views on transgender people, more often trans women, being percieved as sexual
predators. Whether is it a new bathroom bill or women only spaces, trans women are there to be
sexually aggressive to cisgender women. This argument has been debunked multiple times with,
“zero proven incidents in the more than 17 states and 200 cities where transgender people are
currently protected from discrimination and allowed to use public bathrooms that correspond
with their gender identity.” But time and time again, parts of the media cite this propaganda as
‘evidence’. As Time magazine compares it, it is like when anit-gay advocates “circulated
propaganda like videos saying ‘the homosexual’ lurks in the bathroom waiting to prey on young
boys.” There are no studies that have proven either of these arguments to be true, so why are they
so effective at fear mongering families and women? Time magazine thinks it is because people
do not personally know transwomen. They cite a study done by the Public Religion Research
Institute that says, “just 9% say- [they have a ] personal relationship with someone who is
transgender,” and what is worse it often models such as Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs
are portrayed as a generalized idea of all transwomen (Steinmetz 1). So the poorly depicted trans
woman continues to remain subject to harmful stereotypes that TERFs supposedly try to break
down.

Another very recent form of the predatory rape argument has been seen in women’s
prisons. This is admittedly, more hard to argue because the facts present themselves with little
room for interpretation. Karen White, a 52 year old trans woman, was admitted to New Hall
prison in Wakefield, West Yorkshire after stabbing a neighbor. While in prison sectioned with
other women, she committed several acts of rape and other accounts of sexual assault. However,
in an article by The Guardian, Karen White, before known as Stephen Wood, had been sentenced
and “convicted of indecent exposure when she deliberately exposed herself near a children’s
playground.” In addition to this incident, two other cases of “gross indecency” were charged to
her which she served 18 months. While nothing excuses, or can justify those horrific deeds, the
blame can not simply be left only on Karen White’s shoulder. Yes she committed horrendous
acts of sexual violence, but this does not warrant demolishing all strides made towards equal
rights for trans women. As stated, the justice system was aware that Karen White had committed
these acts under her previous name and did not choose to take precautions against it. This is
clearly the fault of the legal system, as they chose to ignore White’s aforementioned sentences
because she had transitioned.

Regardless of the United Kingdom’s transgender policy within prisons, it should be
obvious to a judge that people who are convicted of sexual violence should not be allowed the
same rights and regulations of someone with lesser charges. It is also evident that just because
this case is a proven trans woman perpetrator, it does not mean a previous history can be ignored
for the sake of TERFs proving their point. Karen White is a hideous person with mental issues
who struggles with her own gender identity, but this does not directly correlate to every
transgender woman being a predator. In fact, trans women suffer more at the hands of rapists in
prison. According to the Office of Justice Programs, “Fifteen percent of transgender individuals
report being sexually assaulted while in police custody or jail, which more than doubles (32
percent) for African-American transgender people.” This goes without mentioning that, “at least
200 trans people, primarily trans women of color from the global South, are murdered each year”
(Kaveney 1). Still, a lot goes unreported or is ignored entirely. Yet for TERFs, it has become
increasingly easy to ignore true facts in favor of reporting one case to promote a point. In fact,
for TERF Bev Jo Von Dohre, the statistics don’t matter. She was quoted saying that, “They
expect we’ll be shocked to see statistics about them being killed, and don’t realize, some of us
wish they would all be dead” (Kaveney 1).

The TERF ideology has long since plagued trans women as a form of discrimination and
transphobia. Gervais has shown us just how widespread some of their ideas or ‘jokes’ have
permeated into the mainstream ‘orthodoxy’ and the lack of seriousness surrounding trans
equality. It is time to see past the twisted facts, the lies, and the inherent hate to come together
and allow women to empower themselves for the good of all women, not just those born with
vaginas. It is an outdated, hypocritical form of feminism that TERFs present to everyone and it
propagates hate in the hearts of women from both sides. The time has come to embrace all facets
of womanhood, whether one is born that way or becomes one. Because, I fear, that if we do not
try to promote education, acceptance, and equality for trans women as part of the feminist
community, the world remains more than ignorant: it allows for the bonds of feminism to break.
