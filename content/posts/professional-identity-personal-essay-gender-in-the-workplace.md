My life, admittedly, is not ‘normal’ like most others. I put quotations around normal
because I understand that society dictates social normalities. Still, I reject the idea that there is
one ideal that we as a society should all mold ourselves into. Therefore, I will acknowledge the
term ‘normal’ only as a frame of reference. I am not ‘normal’ because I am a transgender, gay,
autistic white male. These identities do not define who I am; they are who I am. “I am
transgender” is a statement of pride that I often tell people. This is because my life experiences
have led me to embrace and love myself so that I feel more connected to others when I share my
identities. I think this is an important trait I hold in relation to becoming a counselor because I
believe it will allow me to connect with clients on a deeper level and be more understanding of
them.

However, I understand that this is not the case for every gender non-conforming
individual, which is why I wanted to delve into the article by Veronica M. Wanzer, Geneva M.
Gray & Corinne W. Bridges entitled, “Lived Experiences of Professional Counselors with
Gender Diverse Clients.” The article is about a hermeneutic phenomenological study that looks
at seven licensed counselors who work with gender-diverse clients. They developed ten themes
that encompass the counselors' thoughts, views, feelings, and personal connections to their
clients. It was surprising to see how many of the counselors acknowledged their lack of
knowledge of gender non-conforming issues and sought outside education and training to be able
to work better with their clients. As someone from the American South, it is surprising that these
counselors make themselves more aware of their client's issues through outside research. When I
attended therapy in the south, many of my counselors were unaware of what it meant to be
transgender and would often ask me to educate them- as if my personal experiences could guide their work with other transgender clients. I find it reassuring knowing that “Research has
confirmed that counselor professional development is a counselor responsibility (Campbell &
Arkles, 2017), and seeking education about the population from gender diverse clients is a
misstep in the counseling process (Mizock & Lundquist, 2016).” It is informative to me because
now I am aware that I should be doing outside research to constantly gain knowledge and grow
more aware of issues my clients may face.

As someone who has seen many therapists and has been in therapy for many years, I try
to keep in mind what it is like to share your identities with a counselor. This is a huge reason I
began my journey into Applied Psychology: I wanted clients to have someone like them.
Someone who has been through the struggles and can relate on a much more personal level.
There is a lack of diversity in the psychology field (Wanzer et al., 2021), and often discussions
around cultural differences, minority experiences, and racial bias are failed to be brought into the
conversations. Without acknowledging these things, a lot is left up to the imagination, which is
not something psychologists should be practicing. And by bridging the gap between knowledge
and practice, I hope to help a lot of people become more comfortable with their identities.
Finally, something that struck a chord with me while reading this article was the quote,
“Really being mindful that just because somebody comes in as a gender minority, that that might
not be their underlying issue. Their underlying issue might be totally different.” It seems very
simple that not all gender non-conforming people seek help about their gender. But to me, it is a
reminder that should be kept at the forefront of my mind as a counselor. I have a lot of
experience with advocacy for the transgender community and a focus on gender studies, so it is
always on my mind. But as I reflect on my therapy sessions, gender is never something that
comes into play when discussing with my therapist. It tends to be merely a fact in the
