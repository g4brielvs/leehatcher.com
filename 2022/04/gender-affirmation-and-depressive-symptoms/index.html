suicide rate of the U.S. population (Johns et al., 2019; James et al., 2016; Haas, Rodgers, &
Herman, 2014). This is because transgender youth have higher rates of exposure to victimization,
discrimination, and harassment which can lead to depressive symptoms (Austin et al., 2018;
Bauer et al., 2015; Bockting et al., 2013; Johns et al., 2019). Depressive symptoms can include
having a depressed mood, loss of interest in activities one once enjoyed, or thoughts of death or suicide (Torres, 2020). However, protective factors can help reduce the risk of depressive
symptoms (Haas, Rodgers, & Herman, 2014; Johns et al., 2016). Gender affirmation, which can
play a protective role, is the interpersonal confirmation of one’s gender from outside sources,
including calling someone by their preferred name and pronouns (Sevelius, 2017). Gender
affirmations impact how a transgender person feels about themselves, which might impact
depressive symptoms (Sevelius, 2017). This review examines the following research question:
How does gender affirmation affect depressive symptoms among transgender youth?</p><h2 id=gender-affirmations-on-depressive-symptom>Gender Affirmations on Depressive Symptom</h2><p>For transgender youth, depressive symptoms such as loss of interest in activities and
having a depressed mood can present due to low self-esteem, also known as how much one likes
oneself (Arcelus et al., 2016; Romijinders et al., 2017). Low self-esteem affects many aspects of life and can lead to thoughts of death or suicide (Arcelus et al., 2016; Romijinders et al., 2017). Transgender youth have reported having lower self-esteem overall as compared to
non-transgender peers; furthermore, transgender youth highly value increasing their general
self-esteem (Romijinders et al., 2017). Depressive symptoms, as triggered by low self-esteem,
can be alleviated by gender affirmations from different social groups (Kia et al., 2021; Mariccini et al., 2021; Price & Green, 2021).</p><p>Affirmations from adults and or authority figures have been shown to have a significant
positive impact on the self-esteem of transgender youth (Kia et al., 2021; Mariccini et al., 2021; Price & Green, 2021). Factors that negatively impact self-esteem, such as internalized stigma and fears of rejection, can be significantly reduced by receiving affirmations about gender from an adult ( Price & Green, 2021). Having at least one adult in a transgender youth’s life who affirmed their gender lowered depressive symptoms so significantly that it reduced the risk of suicide in the past 12 months by 33% (Price & Green, 2021). Transgender and nonbinary youth also feel a greater sense of safety when a trusted adult gives them affirmation regarding their gender (Kia et al., 2021; Mariccini et al., 2021; Price & Green, 2021). A greater sense of safety raises self-esteem and, in turn, lowers depressive symptoms (Kia et al., 2021; Mariccini et al., 2021; Price & Green, 2021).</p><p>Another element that could impact depressive symptoms is self-perception.
Self-perception is a person’s view of their attributes, mental or physical, that constitute the self; it answers the question: who am I (Torres, 2020). Transgender boys and girls have a significantly lower sense of self-perception as compared to children who did not identify as transgender (Balleur-van Rijn et al., 2012). This means that transgender youth were more unsure of their personhood (Balleur-van Rijn et al., 2012). Among transgender and gender-nonconforming
youth and young adults, negative self-perception showed to increase depressive symptoms such
as suicidal thoughts (Balleur-van Rijn et al., 2012; Durwood et al., 2017; Kuper et al., 2018).
Negative self-perception, like self-esteem, can be mitigated by gender affirmations from different social groups (Kia et al., 2021; Price & Green, 2021). Specifically, peer support raised self-perception and decreased depressive symptoms (Kia et al., 2021; Price & Green, 2021). Having a peer who was accepting and gender-affirming lowered the suicide risk among
transgender youth (Kia et al., 2021; Price & Green, 2021). The considerable protective support
from peers served to bolster self-perception and consequently lowered depressive symptoms (Kia
et al., 2021; Price & Green, 2021). Some findings indicate that higher self-perception and greater perceived peer support could predict better positive mental health outcomes for transgender youth (Grossman et al., 2011; Fontanari et al., 2020; Pollitt et al., 2021). In doing so, these protective factors show a significant effect on transgender youth’s overall well-being. (Boza & Perry, 2014; Kota et al., 2020; Kuper et al., 2018; Moody & Smith, 2013; Veale et al., 2017; Zeluf et al., 2018).</p><p>Apart from self-esteem and self-perception, transgender youth are also particularly likely
to suffer from negative perceptions of their bodies (Grannis et al., 2021; Hayden, 2020; McGuire
et al., 2016). Over two-thirds (70%) of transgender youth reported body dissatisfaction (McGuire
et al., 2021). Most experience depressive symptoms related to their body image issues, such as
loss of interest in activities once enjoyed, suicidal thoughts, and depressed mood (Grannis et al., 2021; Hayden, 2020; McGuire et al., 2016; Romito et al., 2021). While body image issues are an extremely influential factor for depressive symptoms, there is a different type of gender
affirmation outside of social support that can lower those depressive symptoms (Mariccini et al., 2021; Price & Green, 2021). Physical affirmations that affirm one’s gender can alleviate negative thoughts regarding body image (Kia et al., 2021; Mariccini et al., 2021; Price & Green, 2021; Turban et al., 2020; van der Miesen et al., 2018). One type of physical affirmation that has shown promising outcomes for young transgender individuals involves medical intervention; puberty suppressors, which block the onset of puberty, are able to extend the period of prepubescence for transgender youth. This allows them more time to decide the next steps of their gender transition as well as giving them less or no time to experience the process of puberty of the gender they do not identify with (Turban et al., 2020; van der Miesen et al., 2018). Puberty blockers have been shown to improve mental health outcomes, such as lowering negative thoughts about body image (Turban et al., 2020; van der Miesen et al., 2018). This type of gender affirmation care also resulted in lower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation and had an overall positive impact on body image (Grannis et al., 2020; Turban et al., 2020). These types of medical and physical gender affirmation care aided in lowering depressive symptoms by raising self-esteem and self-perception related to their physical appearance; there were fewer thoughts of suicide, more interest in activities once enjoyed, and a less depressed mood (Kia et al., 2021; Mariccini et al., 2021; Price & Green, 2021; Turban et al. 2020; van der Miesen et al., 2018).</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>The literature on gender affirmations for transgender youth tends to indicate that gender
affirmations promote better mental health for those exposed to them (Boza & Perry, 2014;
Durwood et al.; Kaplan et al., 2016; Kia et al., 2021; Kota et al., 2020; Kuper et al., 2018;
Mariccini et al., 2021; Moody & Smith, 2013; Price & Green, 2021; Turban et al., 2020; Veale et
al., 2017; Zeluf et al., 2018). Raising self-esteem, self-concept, and thoughts on personal body
image were all found to have positive influences on depressive symptoms (Balleur-van Rijn et
al., 2012; Grannis et al., 2021; Hayden, 2020; Kuper et al., 2018; McGuire et al., 2016).
However, there are limitations within the literature. Small sample sizes restrict the validity and ability to generalize findings. There are also many gaps within the literature that do not address the intersectionality between self-esteem, self-perception, and body image and how they affect depressive symptoms in transgender youth. Future research should examine more closely the direct and indirect effects that gender affirmation from multiple psychosocial supports has on transgender youth. By looking at both direct and indirect effects, knowledge regarding how to best and most effectively support transgender youth could be gleaned. Additionally, by observing the topic with multiple types of psychosocial support, it could be possible to learn where and from whom support is needed the
most.</p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ul><li><p>Arcelus, J., Claes, L., Witcomb, G. L., Marshall, E., & Bouman, W. P. (2016). Risk factors for
