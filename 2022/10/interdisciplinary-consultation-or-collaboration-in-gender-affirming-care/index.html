These conventions suggest the best practice of care and the continuation of future TGNC care. The common thread of the articles helps to answer the question: How can mental health professionals provide affirmative care to their transgender clients in which they feel validated and supported within their practice? The three articles and book I have chosen to discuss are prevalent to me as a transgender person, and all have aided in informing me of the expectations and realities of working with TGNC clients. I chose them in particular because of my own wry experiences in counseling and because they offered insight, as a future therapist, into what is considered the nuanced professional approach to psychotherapy for TGNC individuals.</p><p>The first piece of content I want to address is the book A Clinician’s Guide to Gender- Affirming Care Working with Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Clients. This book guides the reader through the prevalent history, considerations, contexts, and ways of implementing Gender-Affirming Care (GAC) for their clients. It denotes GAC as “general respect for and responsiveness to the client’s identity and needs” and goes on to describe how the aforementioned history, context, and considerations are all important to being a well-informed MHP (Chang et al., 2018). It also talks about transition-related care and gives an overview of how to employ GAC within a practice (Chang et al., 2018). Chang and colleagues detail specific scenarios and appropriate responses using GAC. The efficacy of GAC is not directly mentioned and comes off as exactly what its title intends: a guide. However, it does begin to answer the prevailing question; GAC is generally accepted by MHPs as a practical framework for working with TGNC clientele. It focuses on the affirmation of the client, a good therapeutic relationship, and continued learning and knowledge gained through outside sources. However, these three factors do not fully encompass or nurture their client&rsquo;s needs of support.</p><p>So, how can GAC be improved so that it achieves more inclusive support for a client? A Clinician&rsquo;s Guide to Gender-Affirming Care begins to enumerate this by articulating the need for Interdisciplinary Consultation and Collaboration (ICC) in the healthcare setting for TGNC clients. ICC is the process of a provider consulting or collaborating with other service providers to try and achieve the most comprehensive and best care for a client. However, it does not expound on how to do so and all the facets that affect their client when it comes to ICC.</p><p>The article by Ducheny et al., “TGNC-Affirmative Interdisciplinary Collaborative Care,” helps pick up where Chang and colleagues fall short in their outlook. It talks about how ICC can affect physical and social transition aspects for TGNC clients and how it can be relieving for them as they do not have to act as a conduit between providers (Ducheny et al., 2017). Further, Ducheny et al. denote the criticalness of ICC within GAC. It states how ICC can improve health outcomes and the effectiveness of treatment for TGNC clients, further stating that service quality is enhanced due to the smoother continuation of care (Ducheny et al., 2017). ICC is meant to guide MHPs through collaborative efforts to develop a comprehensive treatment plan that cares for the clients&rsquo; biopsychosocial profile and more effectively addresses their needs (Ducheny et al., 2017). Ducheny et al. then provide typical roles for MHPs within ICC, such as dealing with medical systems, access, and procedures. The article also gives examples of the types of medical interventions TGNCs may choose to go through as part of their transition and what each means from a medical standpoint (Ducheny et al., 2017). The article lacks the atmosphere GAC creates by putting it in a purely medical outlook, yet does an excellent job informing readers about TGNC issues (Ducheny et al., 2017). However, one downside it mentions is providers&rsquo; extensive work to establish and maintain corroboration.
This downside, while minor, brings up the need to deal with other factors that may preclude an MHP from providing adequate services to their TGNC clients. Where the Ducheny article falls short, Mizock and Lundquist bridge the gap. “Missteps in Psychotherapy With Transgender Clients: Promoting Gender Sensitivity in Counseling and Psychological Practice,” grapples with the boundaries that prevent MHPs from providing GAC to TGNC clients. When thinking about the original question, it is pertinent to think of hindrances to validating TGNC clients because this means you are no longer using GAC. Missteps include: education burdening, gender inflation/ narrowing/ generalizing/ repairing/ pathologizing, and gate-keeping ( Mizock & Lundquist, 2016). Each in its own way takes away from validating a client’s gender and creating a safe, conducive environment for GAC ( Mizock & Lundquist, 2016). Education burdening, for example, deals with a client who feels the need to continually educate their provider with TGNC information and issues outside the realm of their personal experiences ( Mizock & Lundquist, 2016). This weakens the therapeutic relationship and often breaks the bonds of GAC due to a practitioner&rsquo;s lack of knowledge or willingness to do outside research ( Mizock & Lundquist, 2016). Additionally, it may create a barrier between the client and the practitioner, that is not conducive to treatment at all.</p><p>This thought is validated in “The Counseling Experiences of Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Clients” when their study introduces a client named Taye, who is angered by their therapist&rsquo;s lack of TGNC knowledge. They tell the therapist, “Feeling angered by an interaction with a counselor, Taye said, “Do you even know what trans means? Do you understand the history? Do you understand basic stuff like, don’t ask me what my birth name was?” Not only that but TGNC participants “reported feeling disrespected by and mistrustful of MHPs who lacked basic knowledge of TGNC experiences or concerns.” This article by McCullough et al. proves within their sample group that all of the missteps Mizock and Lundquist talk about are indeed what TGNC patients experience in their mental health care. It discusses personal experiences and salient themes that TGNC clients deal with that are not appropriately handled by MHPs (McCullough et al., 2017). In addition, McCullough et al. support the ICC approach to GAC stating that many patients were “seeking support systems beyond mental health services,” and were often tackling the task of relaying between providers. The study ends by stating implications for future research and how it is important for diverse parts of the TGNC population to be included in future research (McCullough et al., 2017).</p><p>To fully thread together the ideas of the works I have discussed, I want to delve into how they will affect my future practice as a therapist. As a transgender therapist, I know I will have bias and more personal experiences than cisgender providers. This pitfall in my care may blind me to the thread I have discussed regarding GAC for my clients. I could easily believe that I am able to help the client without considering collaborative care for them or how it may better suit their treatment plan. And although I am well versed in TGNC issues, it is easy to misstep and find myself generalizing, narrowing, or even inflating their problems with their gender identity. And when working with a TGNC client, it is best to keep in mind that, listening and providing affirmation, are key to avoiding such pitfalls.</p><h2 id=references>References</h2><ul><li>Chang, S.
