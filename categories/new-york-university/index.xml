Transgender youth face much higher suicide rates as compared to the general United States population. However, protective factors such as gender affirmations can play a protective role. This proposal looks to review the effects of gender affirmations in the form of medical interventions on body dissatisfaction and suicidal ideations for transgender youth. Interviews will be implemented at clinics within a region that supply puberty blockers to transgender youth to collect qualitative data regarding their thoughts of suicidal ideations before, during, and after their exposure to puberty blockers.</description></item></channel></rss>
