These conventions suggest the best practice of care and the continuation of future TGNC care. The common thread of the articles helps to answer the question: How can mental health professionals provide affirmative care to their transgender clients in which they feel validated and supported within their practice?

These identities do not define who I am; they are who I am.</description></item><item><title>Gender Affirmation and Depressive Symptoms</title><link>https://leehatcher.com/2022/04/gender-affirmation-and-depressive-symptoms/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leehatcher.com/2022/04/gender-affirmation-and-depressive-symptoms/</guid><description>The lifetime suicide rate for transgender youth is around 45%, roughly nine times the suicide rate of the U.S. population (Johns et al., 2019; James et al., 2016; Haas, Rodgers, &amp;amp; Herman, 2014). This is because transgender youth have higher rates of exposure to victimization, discrimination, and harassment which can lead to depressive symptoms (Austin et al., 2018; Bauer et al., 2015; Bockting et al., 2013; Johns et al., 2019). Depressive symptoms can include having a depressed mood, loss of interest in activities one once enjoyed, or thoughts of death or suicide (Torres, 2020).</description></item></channel></rss>
