Currently, this transition is not being supported for BIPOC students in psychology programs based on a lack of the aforementioned. To better understand what impacts their transition, this proposal aims to investigate the program entitled “NYU’s Quality Undergraduate Education and Scholarly Training” (QUEST). QUEST is an Applied Psychology program that aims to mitigate negative transitional factors through mentorship and engagement in graduate research projects.</description></item></channel></rss>
